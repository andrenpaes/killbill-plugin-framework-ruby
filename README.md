killbill-plugin-framework-ruby
==============================

Framework to write Killbill plugins in Ruby.

There are various types of plugins one can write for Killbill:

1. notifications plugins, which listen to external bus events and can react to it
2. payment plugins, which are used to issue payments against a payment gateway

Both types of plugin can interact with Killbill directly via killbill-library APIs and expose HTTP endpoints.

How to write a Notification plugin
----------------------------------

    require 'killbill'

    class MyNotificationPlugin < Killbill::Plugin::Notification
      # Overriding this method is optional, only if you need to do some initialization work
      def start_plugin
        puts "MyNotificationPlugin plugin starting"
        super
        puts "MyNotificationPlugin plugin started"
      end

      # Invoked each time an event is received
      def on_event(event)
        puts "Received Killbill event #{event}"
      end

      # Overriding this method is optional, only if you need to do some tear down work
      def stop_plugin
        puts "MyNotificationPlugin plugin stopping"
        super
        puts "MyNotificationPlugin plugin stopped"
      end
    end

Make sure to create the corresponding killbill.properties file:

    mainClass=MyNotificationPlugin
    pluginType=NOTIFICATION

How to write a Payment plugin
-----------------------------

    require 'killbill'

    class MyPaymentPlugin < Killbill::Plugin::Payment
      def start_plugin
        puts "MyPaymentPlugin plugin starting"
        super
        puts "MyPaymentPlugin plugin started"
      end

      def process_payment(kb_account_id, kb_payment_id, kb_payment_method_id, amount, currency, context)
      end

      def get_payment_info(kb_account_id, kb_payment_id, context)
      end

      def search_payments(search_key, offset, limit, context)
      end

      def process_refund(kb_account_id, kb_payment_id, refund_amount, currency, context)
      end

      def get_refund_info(kb_account_id, kb_payment_id, context)
      end

      def search_refunds(search_key, offset, limit, context)
      end

      def add_payment_method(kb_account_id, kb_payment_method_id, payment_method_props, set_default, context)
      end

      def delete_payment_method(kb_account_id, kb_payment_method_id, context)
      end

      def get_payment_method_detail(kb_account_id, kb_payment_method_id, context)
      end

      def set_default_payment_method(kb_account_id, kb_payment_method_id, context)
      end

      def get_payment_methods(kb_account_id, refresh_from_gateway, context)
      end

      def search_payment_methods(search_key, offset, limit, context)
      end

      def reset_payment_methods(kb_account_id, payment_methods)
      end

      # Overriding this method is optional, only if you need to do some tear down work
      def stop_plugin
        puts "MyPaymentPlugin plugin stopping"
        super
        puts "MyPaymentPlugin plugin stopped"
      end
    end

Make sure to create the corresponding killbill.properties file:

    mainClass=MyPaymentPlugin
    pluginType=PAYMENT


How to write a Payment plugin integrated with ActiveMerchant
------------------------------------------------------------

Use the plugin generator:

    ./script/generate active_merchant gateway_name /path/to/dir

Replace `gateway_name` with the snake case of your ActiveMerchant gateway (e.g. `yandex`, `stripe`, `paypal`, etc.).

This will generate a tree of files ready to be plugged into Kill Bill. To package the plugin, run:

    rake killbill:clean ; rake build ; rake killbill:package

Most of the work consists of filling in the blank in `api.rb` (payment plugin API for ActiveMerchant gateways) and `application.rb` (sinatra application for ActiveMerchant integrations). Check the [Stripe plugin](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-stripe-plugin) for an example.

In case the templates behind the generator change and you want to upgrade your plugin, you can re-run the above
generate command on top of your existing code. For each file, you'll be prompted whether you want to overwrite it, show a
diff, etc.


How to expose HTTP endpoints
----------------------------

Killbill exports a Rack handler that interfaces directly with the container in which killbill-server runs (e.g. Jetty).

This basically means that Killbill will understand native Rack config.ru files placed in the root of your plugin, e.g. (using Sinatra):

    require 'sinatra'

    get "/plugins/myPlugin/ping" do
      status 200
      "pong"
    end
    run Sinatra::Application


Rake tasks
----------

The killbill gem also ships helpful Rake tasks to package Killbill-ready plugins.

To access these tasks, add the following to your Rakefile:

    # Install tasks to package the plugin for Killbill
    require 'killbill/rake_task'
    Killbill::PluginHelper.install_tasks

    # (Optional) Install tasks to build and release your plugin gem
    require 'bundler/setup'
    Bundler::GemHelper.install_tasks

You can verify these tasks are available by running `rake -T`.

To build the artifacts into pkg/:

    # Cleanup output directories
    rake killbill:clean
    # Build your plugin gem in the pkg/ directory
    rake build
    # Build the Killbill plugin in the pkg/ directory
    # The <plugin_name>-<plugin-version>/ directory is used as a staging directory
    rake killbill:package

For quick testing of your plugin, you can use the `deploy` task:

    # Deploy the plugin in /var/tmp/bundles
    rake killbill:deploy
    # Deploy the plugin and clobber a previous version if needed
    rake killbill:deploy[true]
    # You can also specify a custom plugins directory as such
    rake killbill:deploy[false,/path/to/bundles]
